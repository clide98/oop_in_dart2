This challenge is designed to assess a learner's understanding of advanced object-oriented programming in Dart.

The challenge is to create a program that meets the following requirements:

Create two classes, one for a student and one for a teacher.
The student class should have a name, age and grade level.
The teacher class should have a name, age, and the subject they teach.
Create a method in the student class that prints out the student's information.
Create a method in the teacher class that prints out the teacher's information.
Create a third class that creates a student and teacher object, and calls the methods to print out the information.


This created program defines two classes: 
Student and Teacher. Each class has its own properties and a printInfo method to print the object's information. The main function creates instances of these classes and calls their respective printInfo methods.
This is a basic example of object-oriented programming in Dart. It demonstrates concepts like classes, objects, methods, and constructors. While not strictly advanced OOP, it's a good foundation for further exploration of concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
